## Binary Classification Models Comparison
This is a Python machine learning project where I created various binary classification models to compare their effectiveness. Models were personally designed and validated on toy data. The models were then used with a dataset of accelerometer readings to predict whether an individual was standing or not standing. After each model was trained and tested on the accelerometer dataset, metrics were recorded and compared to determine which model had the best performance.

### Models Used
<ul>
  <li>Pocket Algorithm</li>
  <li>Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA)</li>
  <li>Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)</li>
  <li>Logistic Regression</li>
</ul>
